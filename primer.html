    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>Empowering communities through democratized access to autonomous transportation.</p>
    
    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>A world where autonomous vehicles serve humanity's collective needs rather than corporate interests alone.</p>
    
    <h2>What We're Building</h2>
    
    <h3>Open Source Autonomous Platform</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Community-owned fleet management system</li>
        <li>Transparent AI decision-making frameworks</li>
        <li>Decentralized coordination protocols</li>
        <li>Privacy-first rider experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Current autonomous vehicle development concentrates power and profit in the hands of a few corporations. Project Arete offers an alternative: technology that belongs to everyone, governed by community consensus, and designed to serve public good.</p>
