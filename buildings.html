        <h1>Arete Smart Buildings</h1>
        
        <section>
            <p>Arete transforms building operations by making each building's Arete the single trusted authority for its data, enabling consistent, secure management for all assets and applications.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Digital Confidence for Buildings</h2>
            <p>Imagine a commercial building where every system—lighting, HVAC, security, and facility apps—operates smoothly through a single source of truth.</p>
            <p>That's the Arete advantage: shifting from siloed devices and scattered data to genuine operational consistency built for business reliability.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;">The Building's Digital Heart - Arete serving as a trusted orchestrator</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Building's Digital Heart</h2>
            <p>At the center of building's information management is Arete, serving as a trusted orchestrator for all connected systems. Facility apps, monitoring tools, utility meters, and security feeds connect either on-premises using IBB hosts or through secure cloud environments.</p>
            <p>Arete's consistent behavior—secure, interoperable, resilient, and plug-n-play—lets business professionals manage operations with confidence, trusting every interaction to follow modern security and open standards.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>If All Buildings Used Arete...</h2>
            <p>Once a building adopts Arete, the playbook for operational success becomes scalable. Now, imagine every building in your company's portfolio equipped with its own Arete.</p>
            <p>Each Arete reliably manages its building's internal assets and coordinates with trusted external service providers, government-provided services, and utility grids, while also managing your fleet's portfolio, all using standards-based interactions securely.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Arete Across the Fleet</h2>
            <p>When Arete powers each property in a real estate portfolio, asset management transitions from isolated points to an integrated, context-aware system-of-systems.</p>
            
            <div class="card" style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 75%;">
                <img src="Arete-fleet.png" alt="Arete Fleet Management" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;">Arete Across the Fleet - Integrated portfolio management</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Arete units in different buildings can collaborate, share data where permitted, and connect to higher-level orchestrators, such as a city-wide smart city orchestrator, which itself is an Arete for the city, coordinating infrastructure, buildings, and transportation across the smart city.</p>
            <p>This creates seamless pathways for government, service organizations, and business operators to dynamically optimize their interactions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Flexibility for the Future</h2>
            <p>Arete isn't just a tool for today; its open-source, modular architecture means each building or portfolio can adapt quickly to new service providers, evolving regulations, or emerging technology trends. It's a living platform, where orchestration for provider and consumer roles shapes the future of operations, security, and business growth.</p>
