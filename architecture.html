            <p>The Arete orchestration process provides a practical framework for securely connecting systems across diverse domains by leveraging a standardized, context-driven approach. At the heart of Arete are three key steps that bring order and clarity to the complexity of interoperable networks: the gathering of nodes within defined contexts, the careful matching of those contexts, and the binding of capabilities using standardized Connection Profiles. These steps ensure robust, policy-driven integration, making collaboration across systems both secure and dynamic. Below, each step will be described in detail to illustrate the Arete approach.</p>

        <section class="process-steps">
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Step 1: Gathering Nodes</h2>
                <img src="Step1-Gathering Nodes.png" alt="Gathering Nodes" style="width: 75%; height: auto;" />
                <p>The orchestrator collects all Nodes (atomic systems or services) within its Realm, relying on the onboarding twinning process of Nodes from Constituent Systems. This builds a synchronized inventory of Twins of the Nodes that can be filtered or grouped by origin or attributes required for matching Context and Binding Capabilities.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Step 2: Matching Contexts</h2>
                <img src="Step2-MatchingContexts.png" alt="Matching Contexts" style="width: 75%; height: auto;" />
                <p>In Arete, Context is the organizing principle that allows nodes to be grouped and matched for secure interaction. A context can represent a physical space, such as a building, a room, or a piece of equipment. Equally, contexts may be virtual—defining contracts, leases, or tickets within digital or business processes. Finally, contexts can be derived semantically, using rich models like knowledge graphs that capture the meaning and relationships between different entities. This flexible approach means Arete can orchestrate interactions not only by location or asset, but by contracts, service processes, or even abstract concepts described by shared semantics.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Step 3: Binding Capabilities</h2>
                <img src="Step3-BindingCapabilities.png" alt="Binding Capabilities" style="width: 75%; height: auto;" />
                <p>Once Contexts match, the orchestrator analyzes each Node's Capabilities—each described using a standardized Connection Profile (CP). Providers are paired with Consumers, and valid matches result in an enforceable, policy-driven connection instance.</p>
